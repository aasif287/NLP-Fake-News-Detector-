# Welcome to "NLP: Fake News Detector"

## Project Overview
Welcome to the hands-on project, "NLP: Fake News Detector." This project is designed to provide practical experience in natural language processing (NLP) and deep learning. You will be working with the [Fake and Real News Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset) available on Kaggle. Throughout the course, you will apply Python libraries, perform exploratory data analysis, clean text data, and build a deep learning model to detect fake news.

## Course Objectives
In this project, you will achieve the following learning objectives:

1. **Import Libraries and Datasets:**
   - Gain hands-on experience in importing Python libraries for data manipulation and visualization.
   - Acquire the dataset from Kaggle, understand its structure, and load it into your environment.

2. **Perform Exploratory Data Analysis:**
   - Analyze and understand the characteristics of the dataset through statistical and visual methods.
   - Gain insights into the distribution of real and fake news articles.

3. **Perform Data Cleaning:**
   - Implement text data cleaning techniques, including removing punctuation and stop words.
   - Ensure the dataset is preprocessed and ready for analysis.

4. **Visualize the Cleaned Data:**
   - Utilize data visualization tools to present the cleaned data in a meaningful way.
   - Explore word clouds to identify key terms and patterns in the text.

5. **Prepare the Data by Tokenizing and Padding:**
   - Understand the concept of a tokenizer in the context of NLP.
   - Perform tokenization and padding on the text corpus to prepare it for input into the deep learning model.

6. **Build and Train the Model:**
   - Delve into the theory and intuition behind Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM).
   - Apply this understanding to construct and train a deep learning model for fake news detection.

7. **Assess Trained Model Performance:**
   - Evaluate the performance of the trained model using appropriate metrics.
   - Understand the significance of model assessment in the context of fake news detection.
